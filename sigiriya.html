    <h3><font><center>Sigiriya, also called Lion Rock or Lion Mountain, site in central Sri Lanka consisting of the ruins of an ancient stronghold that was built in the late 5th century CE on a remarkable monolithic <br> rock pillar. The rock, which is so steep that its top overhangs the sides, rises to an elevation of 1,144 feet (349 metres) above sea level and is some 600 feet (180 metres) above the surrounding plain.</center></font></h3>

                <h2><center>Sigiriya Rock Fortress</center></h2>
                <p>The Sigiriya Rock Fortress was King Kashyap's intimate residence, surrounded by palaces, pavilions, gardens, and ponds and surrounded by two trenches, and three defenses. It was governed by an intimidating column of rock nearly 600 feet high, surrounded by palaces, pavilions, gardens, and ponds, transforming it into a gorgeous masterpiece. A wonderful tapestry depicting celestial beings was also attached to the rock's circumference. Only 20% of the original structure of this magnificent edifice remains today. Every day at 7 a.m., the stronghold welcomes visitors and registers the final entry at 5 p.m., with a 5.30 p.m. closing time.
                    A $30 guided tour lasts approximately 3-4 hours and is best done early in the morning or late in the afternoon. Reaching the summit takes around an hour or 1½ hours.</p>

                <h2><center>Sigiriya Gardens</center></h2>
                <p>The Royal Gardens, located at the base of Sigiriya Rock, feature a line of exquisite and symmetrically arranged ponds, including bathing pools, pavilions with little islands, arched tanks, and modified edgings.
                    The garden also includes tiered greens and natural rocks that were formerly used to house multiple Buddhist temples, making it a great place to visit away from tourists.</p>

                <h2><center>Sigiriya Summit</center></h2>
                <p>With its spectacular characteristics, Sigiriya Rock's tiered top covers 1.6 hectares. Only the foundations of the buildings remained after the King chose it as his safe capital following his father's killing. A smooth stone wedge around 30 meters from the Dagoba ruins may have been the King's meditation location.
                    Even though it was undoubtedly intended just for holding water, this 27 m × 21 m tank carved out of rock appears to be a modern-century swimming pool!</p>

                <h2><center>Frescoes</center></h2>
                <p>An open spiral flight of stairs halfway up the Sigiriya Rock leads to a long and covered gallery within the rock's architecture. The drawings, which are designed with voluptuous and corset-waisted women who are generally known as the King's concubines, are still in good condition with their bright colors. Although the exact dates of the frescos' creation are unknown, they are thought to be from the fifth century.</p>
